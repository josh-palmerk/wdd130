                <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
                <p> From northern Virginia, I grew up learning all types of skills, hard and soft. The most valuable, however, were from my mother and father. They together taught me discipline, persistence, problem solving, compassion, and good judgment. I learned to “keep the main thing, the main thing.” They engaged my interests and hobbies, and at times had to force me to learn things I didn’t like. We had the classic piano-lessons-for-your-kid scenario, in many things. Including piano. I eventually got them to let me stop the piano lessons, but then I reached a late teenage year and realized I loved music. I especially loved playing the piano. So I picked it up again and really applied myself. I even took a piano class in college and paid for it myself, completely inverting the dynamic. As a result, I am much more willing to explore new things, even if I am initially frustrated by them. And I’m better at the piano.

                <h3>Natural Teacher</h3>
                <p> I am ecstatic about teaching and helping others. I stay after class very often to help people through the problems they face in their homework. I love to see them understand code structures and conventions and develop their technical thinking skills. I love to think of analogies that will help them relate abstract concepts to things they already know. I seem to have a knack for it, too. I’ve received a lot of comments on how helpful my explanations were, and I’ve heard my analogies repeated to others on several occasions. I really just love learning interesting things and explaining them to others with the same enthusiasm I had when I learned it. I’ve been known to rant about things I think are interesting but nobody else really cares about. I explain coding concepts to my girlfriend who doesn’t even know what an if statement is. I’m that guy. But it’s all because I love learning and I want others to know what I know.
