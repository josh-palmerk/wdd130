        A young, sharp mind with an insatiable knack for digesting and applying new concepts. I love tinkering, testing, improving, breaking, optimizing, theorizing, applying. Looking for internship opportunities to grow my limited in-field experience. I've recently begun conducting my own experiments to provide this experience myself. Or at least, I tell myself that's why. It's really just because I enjoy it.
        If you're interested in investing in a mind like mine, I'd be happy to connect and see what I can learn and accomplish in any position I'm offered.

      <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
      <p>
        [A Bit About Me]    
        From northern Virginia, I grew up learning all types of skills, hard and soft. The most valuable, however, were from my mother and father. They together taught me discipline, persistence, problem solving, compassion, and good judgment. I learned to “keep the main thing, the main thing.” They engaged my interests and hobbies, and at times had to force me to learn things I didn’t like. We had the classic piano-lessons-for-your-kid scenario, in many things. Including piano. I eventually got them to let me stop the piano lessons, but then I reached a late teenage year and realized I loved music. I especially loved playing the piano. So I picked it up again and really applied myself. I even took a piano class in college and paid for it myself, completely inverting the dynamic. As a result, I am much more willing to explore new things, even if I am initially frustrated by them. And I’m better at the piano.
        
        
           [Natural Teacher]   
        I am ecstatic about teaching and helping others. I stay after class very often to help people through the problems they face in their homework. I love to see them understand code structures and conventions and develop their technical thinking skills. I love to think of analogies that will help them relate abstract concepts to things they already know. I seem to have a knack for it, too. I’ve received a lot of comments on how helpful my explanations were, and I’ve heard my analogies repeated to others on several occasions. I really just love learning interesting things and explaining them to others with the same enthusiasm I had when I learned it. I’ve been known to rant about things I think are interesting but nobody else really cares about. I explain coding concepts to my girlfriend who doesn’t even know what an if statement is. I’m that guy. But it’s all because I love learning and I want others to know what I know.

           [Bug Hunter] 
        I would be excited to intern as a software tester/bug hunter. I'll shoot a user-accessible hole in any program you want me to, though admittedly I'm still trying to graduate from script-kiddie status. I do, however, have a hobby of making AI tools and chatbots say/do things they aren't supposed to. I've sent many a bug report to applications I use, whether they want them or not. I do this, again, just because I have fun doing it.
        
           [Hardware & Tinkering]    
        I've built my own PC, and yet, I still self-impose the challenge of completing my software engineering assignments on a cheap 4-year-old Chromebook with a poorly-optimized Linux container. I figure it out about 9/10 times, but switch to the PC environment when time/hardware/other constraints require it.
        
           [AI Models]   
        I plan to work with AI systems in the near future, just to see what I can do. I will train my models and showcase them here. I may use it to find solutions to real-world problems using a physics model. I may train it for specific image or speech generation/prediction. I might make it play a video game with inhuman skill. Wait and see.
        
        
        
        You can see my resume here.
